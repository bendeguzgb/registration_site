This app was created by Gerencsér Bendegúz (bendeguz.gb@gmail.com). 
It is meant to be used only for the interview process at ELI-ALPS.

I provided a build.sh script to simplify the build process.

The database already contains some user. 
To make testing easier password constraints has been disabled.

All of the users' password is **pwd**.
